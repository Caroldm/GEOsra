We integrate CLIP-seq and RNA Bind-N-Seq technologies to discover that TAF15 binds to ~4	900 RNAs enriched for GGUA motifs. In the mouse brain TAF15 and FUS but not TDP-43 exhibit strikingly similar RNA binding profiles yet they alter the expression of distinct mRNA populations upon their individual depletions. TAF15 has a minimal role in alternative splicing and instead affects RNA turnover consistent with an enrichment of TAF15 binding sites in 3\\x89\\xdb\\xaa untranslated regions. In human stem cell-derived motor neurons loss of both TAF15 and FUS affected mRNAs distinct from those altered by loss of either protein alone revealing redundant roles for TAF15 and FUS in maintaining mRNA levels. Furthermore concomitant rather than individual depletion of TAF15 and FUS more closely resembles RNA profiles of motor neurons derived from FUS R521G ALS patients or from late-stage sporadic ALS patients. Our study reveals convergent and divergent mechanisms by which FUS TAF15 and TDP-43 affects RNA metabolism in neurological disease.

However it remains enigmatic which cell lineages are commissioned by Hox-TALE factors to generate regional specific pattern and whether other Hox-TALE co-factors exist. In this study we investigated the transcriptional mechanisms controlled by the Shox2 transcriptional regulator in limb patterning. Harnessing an osteogenic lineage-specific Shox2 inactivation approach we show that despite widespread Shox2 expression in multiple cell lineages lack of the stylopod observed upon Shox2 deficiency is a specific result of Shox2 loss of function in the osteogenic lineage. ChIP-Seq revealed robust interaction of Shox2 with cis-regulatory enhancers clustering around skeletogenic genes that are also bound by Hox-TALE factors supporting a lineage autonomous function of Shox2 in osteogenic lineage fate determination and skeleton patterning. Pbx ChIP-Seq further allowed the genome-wide identification of cis-regulatory modules exhibiting co-occupancy of Pbx Meis and Shox2 transcriptional regulators. Integrative analysis of ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq data and transgenic enhancer assays indicate that Shox2 patterns the stylopod as a repressor via interaction with enhancers active in the proximal limb mesenchyme and antagonizes the repressive function of TALE factors in osteogenesis.

In a number of disease contexts such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) macrophage polarization influences the extent of pathogenesis and efforts are underway to eliminate pathogenic subsets. However previous studies have not distinguished whether the simultaneous presence of both classical and alternative activation signatures represents the admixture of differentially polarized macrophages or if they have adopted a unique state characterized by components of both classical and alternative activation. Results: We analyzed the polarization of individual macrophages responding to TBI using single-cell RNA sequencing. Analysis of signature polarization genes revealed diverse activation states including M(IL4) M(IL10) and M(LPS IFN\\xeb_). However the expression of a given polarization marker was no more likely than at random to predict simultaneous expression or repression of markers of another polarization program within the same cell suggesting a lack of exclusivity in macrophage polarization states in vivo in TBI. Also unexpectedly individual TBI macrophages simultaneously expressed high levels of signature polarization genes across two or three different polarization states and in several distinct and seemingly incompatible combinations. Conclusions: Single-cell gene expression profiling demonstrated that monocytic macrophages in TBI are not comprised of distinctly polarized subsets but are uniquely and broadly activated. TBI macrophage activation in vivo is deeply complex with individual cells concurrently adopting both inflammatory and reparative features.

During cancer progression these CGIs undergo hypo-hydroxymethylation prior to subsequent hyper-methylation; whilst retaining H3K27me3. A similar loss of promoter-core 5hmC is observed in Tet1 deficient mouse livers indicating that reduced Tet1 binding at CGIs may be responsible for the epigenetic dysregulation observed during hepatocarcinogenesis. Consistent with this reduced Tet1 protein levels are observed in mouse liver tumour lesions. As in human DNA methylation changes at CGIs do not appear to be direct drivers of hepatocellular carcinoma progression in mice. Instead dynamic changes in H3K27me3 promoter deposition are strongly associated with tumour-specific activation and repression of transcription.

We and others have previously found that the PRC2 subunit Suz12 interacts with RNA in vitro and other studies have shown that Ezh2 and Jarid2 also possess RNA binding function. The interaction of PRC2 with RNA has been suggested to regulate PRC2 targeting or enzymatic activity but the RNAs directly bound by PRC2 in cells and the role of each PRC2 RNA binding subunit remain unclear. We have used different CLIP techniques which use UV-crosslinking to allow detection of direct Suz12-RNA interactions as they occur in living mouse ES cells.

Similarly disruption of Suz12-RNA interactions by RNA polymerase II inhibition or RNase treatment increases Suz12 binding to chromatin.

As genome-wide transcription is organized under the high-order chromosome structure it is unclear how circadian gene expression is influenced by chromosome structure. In this study we focus on the function of chromatin structure proteins cohesin as well as CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) in circadian rhythm. We analyzed the interactome of a Bmal1-bound enhancer upstream of a clock gene Nr1d1 by 4C-seq and observed that cohesin binding sites are enriched in the interactome. Integrating circadian transcriptome data and cistrome data we found that cohesin-CTCF co-binding sites tend to insulate the phases of circadian oscillating genes while cohesin-non-CTCF sites facilitate the interaction between circadian enhancer and promoter. A coarse-grained model integrating the long-range effect of cohesin and CTCF markedly improved our mechanistic understanding of circadian gene expression.

Herein we demonstrated the surprising presence of N6-methyladenine in mammalian genomes especially mouse embryonic stem cells. This modification is enriched at histone variant H2A.X-deposited genomic regions in wild type embryonic stem cells. Our work also showed that a previously unknown DNA demethylase Alkbh1 is the major demethylase for N6-methyladenine in embryonic stem cells. Increase of N6-methyladenine levels in Alkbh1 deficient cells leads to silencing of genes that regulate embryonic development. Surprisingly genes located on the X-chromosome but not the Y-chromosome or autosomes are preferentially silenced by N6-methyladenine. Strikingly N6-methyladenine in Alkbh1 deficient cells are specifically deposition at young full-length subfamilies of LINE1 transposons that are strongly enriched on the X chromosome. Furthermore N6-methyladenine deposition on LINE1s pattern is inversely correlated with their evolutionary age. The deposition of N6-methyladenine results in epigenetic silencing of such L1s which are otherwise actively transcribed in wild type embryonic stem cells and the neighboring enhancers and genes.

Thus Dnmt3a haploinsufficiency transforms Flt3ITD myeloproliferative disease by modulating methylation-sensitive gene expression within a clonogenic AML subpopulation.

Here using a combination of ChIP-seq ChIP-proteomics and RNA-seq experiments in embryonic stem cells we found that Atad2 is an abundant nucleosome-bound protein present on active genes associated with chromatin remodelling DNA replication and DNA repair factors. A structural analysis of its bromodomain and subsequent investigations demonstrate that histone acetylation guides ATAD2 to chromatin resulting in an overall increase of chromatin accessibility and histone dynamics which is required for the proper activity of the highly expressed gene fraction of the genome. While in exponentially growing cells Atad2 appears dispensable for cell growth in differentiating ES cells Atad2 becomes critical in sustaining specific gene expression programs controlling proliferation and differentiation.

The therapeutic benefit or detriment of resultant hybrids is unknown. Here we sought a global view of phenotypic diversification of mesenchymal stem cell-cardiomyocyte hybrids and associated time course. Using single-cell RNA-seq we found hybrids consistently increase ribosome components and decrease genes associated with the cell cycle suggesting an increase in protein production and decrease in proliferation to accommodate the fused state. But in the case of most other gene groups hybrids were individually distinct. In fact though hybrids can express a transcriptome similar to individual fusion partners approximately one-third acquired distinct expression profiles in a single day. Some hybrids underwent reprogramming expressing pluripotency and cardiac precursor genes latent in parental cells and associated with developmental and morphogenic gene groups. Other hybrids expressed genes associated with ontologic cancer sets and two hybrids of separate experimental replicates clustered with breast cancer cells expressing critical oncogenes and lacking tumor suppressor genes. Rapid transcriptional diversification of this type garners consideration in the context of cellular transplantation to damaged tissues those with viral infection or other microenvironmental conditions that might promote fusion.

Loss of UTX in female mice is embryonic lethal. Unexpectedly male UTX-null mice escape embryonic lethality due to expression of UTY a paralog lacking H3K27-demethylase activity. This suggests that UTX plays an enzyme-independent role in development and challenges the need for active H3K27-demethylation in vivo. However the requirement for active H3K27-demethylation in stem cell-mediated tissue regeneration remains untested. Using an inducible mouse knockout that ablates UTX in satellite cells we show that active H3K27-demethylation is necessary for muscle regeneration. Indeed loss of UTX in satellite cells blocks myofiber regeneration in both male and female mice. Furthermore we demonstrate that UTX mediates muscle regeneration through its H3K27-demethylase activity using a chemical inhibitor and a demethylase-dead UTX knock-in mouse. Mechanistically dissection of the muscle regenerative process revealed that UTX is required for expression of the transcription factor Myogenin that drives differentiation of muscle progenitors. Thus we have identified a critical role for the enzymatic activity of UTX in activating muscle-specific gene expression during myofiber regeneration revealing for the first time that active H3K27-demethylation has a physiological role in vivo.

Treatment efficacy may depend on the presence of glioma stem cells expression of DNA repair enzymes such as methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) or transcriptome subtype. Methods: To model genetic alterations in the core signaling pathways of human glioblastoma we induced conditional Rb knockout Kras activation and Pten deletion mutations in cortical murine astrocytes. Serial neurosphere culture multi-lineage differentiation and orthotopic transplantation were used to assess whether these mutations induced de-differentiation of cortical astrocytes into glioma stem cells. Efficacy of radiation and temozolomide was examined in vitro and in an allograft model in vivo. The effects of radiation on transcriptome subtype was examined by expression profiling. Results: G1/S-defective Rb knockout astrocytes gained unlimited self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation capacity in both the presence and absence of Kras and Pten mutations. Only triple mutant astrocytes formed serially-transplantable glioblastoma allografts. Triple mutant astrocytes and allografts were sensitive to radiation but expressed Mgmt and were resistant to temozolomide. Radiation induced a shift in transcriptome subtype of glioblastoma allografts from proneural to mesenchymal. Conclusion: A defined set of core signaling pathway mutations induces de-differentiation of cortical murine astrocytes into glioma stem cells. This non-germline genetically engineered mouse model mimics human proneural glioblastoma on histopathological molecular and treatment response levels. It may be useful in dissecting the genetic and cellular mechanisms of treatment resistance and developing more effective therapies.

Ex vivo studies on isolated single myofibres showed that Setdb1 is required for muscle adult stem cells expansion following activation. In vitro studies in skeletal myoblasts confirmed that Setdb1 suppresses terminal myoblast differentiation. Genomic binding analyses showed a release of Setdb1 from the promoter of selected target genes upon myoblast terminal differentiation concomitant to a nuclear export of Setdb1 to the cytoplasm.

While Rbfox1 functions as a splicing regulator in the nucleus it is also alternatively spliced to produce cytoplasmic isoforms. To investigate cytoplasmic Rbfox1 we knocked down Rbfox proteins in mouse neurons and rescued with cytoplasmic or nuclear Rbfox1. Transcriptome profiling showed that nuclear Rbfox1 rescued splicing changes induced by knockdown whereas cytoplasmic Rbfox1 rescued changes in mRNA levels. iCLIP-seq of subcellular fractions revealed that in nascent RNA Rbfox1 bound predominantly to introns while cytoplasmic Rbox1 bound to 3 UTRs. Cytoplasmic Rbfox1 binding increased target mRNA stability and translation and overlapped significantly with miRNA binding sites. Cytoplasmic Rbfox1 target mRNAs were enriched in genes involved in cortical development and autism.

It has been suggested that a number of H2A ubiquitin ligases as well as deubiquitylases and related peptide fragments contribute to a delicate balance between self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation in mES cells. Here we tested whether known H2A ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitylases are involved in mES cell regulation and discovered that Dzip3 the E3 ligase of H2AK119 represses differentiation-inducible genes as well as Ring1B. The two sets of target genes partially overlapped but had different spectra. We found that Dzip3 represses gene expression by orchestrating changes in 3D organization in addition to regulating ubiquitylation of H2A.

Here we demonstrate the causal role of EZH2 overexpression in NSCLC with a new genetically-engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma.

While inflammation is associated with increased gene-expression that is linked to a subset of transcription factors de-regulation of plasticity genes is mediated via different mechanisms in the amyloid and the aging model. Amyloid pathology impairs histone-acetylation and decreases expression of plasticity genes while aging affects differential splicing that is linked to altered H4K12 acetylation at the intron-exon junction in neurons but not in non-neuronal cells.

Secondly to determine the transcriptional consequence of an absence of ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing. Methods: Fetal liver mRNA profiles of embryonic day 12.5 wild-type (WT) and ADAR1 editing-deficient (ADAR1E861A) mice were generated by RNA sequencing in triplicate (biological replicates) using Illumina HiSeq2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript level with TopHat followed by Cufflinks. qRT\\x89\\xdb\\xd2PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays.

Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow we mapped about 30 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm9) and identified 14	484 transcripts in the fetal livers of WT and ADAR1E861A mice with BWA. RNA-seq data had a goodness of fit (R2) of &gt;0.94 between biological triplicates per genotype. Approximately 4.4% of the transcripts showed differential expression between the WT and ADAR1E861A fetal liver with a LogFC\\x89\\xe4\\xb41.5 and p value &lt;0.05.

However DNA hypomethylation occurs during specific developmental stages (e.g. preimplantation embryos) and in certain cell types (e.g. primordial germ cells). The absence of dysregulated repetitive elements in these cells suggests the existence of alternative mechanisms that prevent genome instability triggered by DNA hypomethylation. In this report we seek to elucidate the factors that play a critical role in ensuring genome stability by focusing on DAXX and ATRX two proteins that have been linked to transcriptional control and epigenetic regulation. We carried out ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses to compare the genome-wide binding and transcriptome profiles of DAXX and ATRX in mouse ES (mES) cells triple knocked out for the three mammalian DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) (TKO cells) to those in wildtype mES cells. Our data indicate that DAXX and ATRX are distinct in their chromatin-binding profiles and highly co-enriched at tandem repetitive elements. Global DNA hypomethylation as was the case in TKO cells further promoted the recruitment of the DAXX/ATRX complex to tandem repeat sequences including IAP (intracisternal A\\x89\\xdb\\x90particle) retrotransposons and telomeres. Inhibition of DAXX or ATRX in cells with hypomethylated genomes (e.g. TKO cells mES cells cultured in ground-state conditions and preimplantation embryos) increased aberrant transcriptional de-repression of repeat elements and dysfunction at telomeres. Furthermore we provide evidence that DAXX/ATRX-dependent silencing may occur through DAXX\\x89\\xdb\\xaas interaction with SUV39H1 and increased H3K9me3 on repetitive sequences. Our study suggests that DAXX and ATRX are important for safeguarding the genome particularly in silencing repetitive elements in the absence of DNA methylation.

Previous studies have shown that histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) inhibits the binding of de novo DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt) through the ATRX-DNMT3-DNMTL (ADD) domain thus protecting H3K4me3 marked CpG islands (CGI) from DNA methylation. In addition to H3K4me3 we identified antagonistic relationship between H3T3 phosphorylation and the binding of the ADD domain to the unmodified H3 N-terminus. To assess the physiological relevance of these restrictions we engineered the wild-type ADD domain of Dnmt3a (WT) to permit additional binding to either H3K4me3 (WWD) or H3T3ph (R) and stably introduced FLAG-tagged full-length normal or mutant Dnmt3a2 into ESCs lacking all Dnmts (TKO; triple knock-out of Dnmt1 Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) using the PiggyBac transposon system.

ChIP-sequencing was used to map SIM2 binding in mouse embryonic stem cells and has revealed 1229 high-confidence SIM2-binding sites. Analysis of the SIM2 target genes confirmed the importance of SIM2 in developmental and neuronal processes and indicated that SIM2 may be a master transcription regulator. Indeed SIM2 DNA binding sites share sequence specificity and overlapping domains of occupancy with master transcription factors such as SOX2 OCT4 NANOG or KLF4. The association between SIM2 and these pioneer factors is supported by the finding that SIM2 can be co-immunoprecipitated with SOX2 OCT4 NANOG or KLF4.

Young ItpkB-/- mice accumulated phenotypic HSC and showed extramedullary hematopoiesis. ItpkB-/- HSC were less quiescent and proliferated more than wildtype controls. They downregulated quiescence and stemness associated mRNAs but upregulated activation oxidative metabolism protein synthesis and lineage associated transcripts. Although they showed no significant homing defects ItpkB-/- HSC had a severely reduced competitive long-term repopulating potential. Aging ItpkB-/- mice lost hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and died with severe anemia. Wildtype HSC normally repopulated ItpkB-/- hosts incidating a HSC-intrinsic ItpkB requirement. ItpkB-/- HSC had reduced cobblestone-area forming cell activity in vitro and showed increased stem-cell-factor activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) effector Akt reversed by exogenous provision of the known PI3K/Akt antagonist IP4. They also showed transcriptome changes consistent with hyperactive Akt/mTOR signaling. Thus we propose that ItpkB ensures HSC quiescence by limiting cytokine-induced PI3K signaling in HSC.

MECP2 encodes a methyl-DNA-binding protein that is proposed to function as a transcriptional repressor but despite numerous studies examining neuronal gene expression in MeCP2 mutants no coherent model has emerged for how MeCP2 regulates transcription. Here we identify a genome-wide length-dependent increase in the expression of long genes in neurons lacking MeCP2. This gene misregulation occurs in human RTT brains and correlates with onset and severity of phenotypes in Mecp2 mutant mice suggesting that the disruption of long gene expression contributes to RTT pathology. We present evidence that MeCP2 represses long genes by binding to brain-enriched methylated CA dinucleotides within genes and show that loss of methylated CA in the brain recapitulates gene expression defects observed in MeCP2 mutants. We find that long genes encode proteins with neuronal functions and overlap substantially with genes that have been implicated in autism and Fragile X syndrome. Reversing the overexpression of long genes in neurons lacking MeCP2 can improve some RTT-associated cellular deficits. These findings suggest that a function of MeCP2 in the mammalian brain is to temper the expression of genes in a length-dependent manner and that mutations in MeCP2 and possibly other autism genes may cause neurological dysfunction by disrupting the expression of long genes in the brain.

MEF2 transcription factors play essential roles in this process but how these broadly expressed factors contribute to the generation of specific cell types during development is poorly understood. Here we show that despite being expressed in virtually all mammalian tissues in the retina MEF2D binds to retina-specific enhancers and controls photoreceptor cell development. MEF2D achieves specificity by cooperating with a retina-specific factor CRX which recruits MEF2D away from canonical MEF2 binding sites and redirects it to retina-specific enhancers that lack the consensus MEF2 sequence. Once bound to retina-specific enhancers MEF2D and CRX co-activate the expression of photoreceptor-specific genes that are critical for retinal function. These findings demonstrate that broadly expressed TFs acquire specific functions through competitive recruitment to enhancers by tissue-specific TFs and through cooperative activation of these enhancers to regulate tissue-specific genes.

Recent epidemiological studies link exposure to pollutants that bind the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) during development with poorer immune responses later in life. Yet how developmental triggering of AHR durably alters immune cell function remains unknown. Using a mouse model we show that developmental activation of AHR leads to long-lasting reduction in the response of CD8+ T cells during influenza virus infection cells critical for resolving primary infection. Combining genome-wide approaches we demonstrate that developmental activation alters DNA methylation and gene expression patterns in isolated CD8+ T cells prior to and during infection. Altered transcriptional profiles in CD8+ T cells from developmentally exposed mice reflect changes in pathways involved in proliferation and immunoregulation with an overall pattern that bears hallmarks of T cell exhaustion. Developmental exposure also changed DNA methylation across the genome but differences were most pronounced following infection where we observed inverse correlation between promoter methylation and gene expression. This points to altered regulation of DNA methylation as one mechanism by which AHR causes durable changes in T cell function. Discovering that distinct gene sets and pathways were differentially changed in developmentally exposed mice prior to and after infection further reveals that the process of CD8+ T cell activation is rendered fundamentally different by early life AHR signaling. These findings reveal a novel role for AHR in the developing immune system: regulating DNA methylation and gene expression as immune cells respond to viral infection later in life.

H3K27me3 is enriched at the promoters of a large cohort of developmental genes in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Loss of H3K27me3 leads to a failure of ESCs to properly differentiate which presents a major roadblock for dissecting the precise roles of PRC2 activity during lineage commitment. While recent studies suggest that loss of H3K27me3 leads to changes in DNA methylation in ESCs how these two pathways coordinate to regulate gene expression programs during lineage commitment is poorly understood. Here we analyzed gene expression and DNA methylation levels in several PRC2 mutant ESC lines that maintain varying levels of H3K27me3. We found that maintenance of intermediate levels of H3K27me3 allowed for proper temporal activation of lineage genes during directed differentiation of ESCs to spinal motor neurons (SMNs). However genes that function to specify other lineages failed to be repressed suggesting that PRC2 activity is necessary for lineage fidelity. We also found that H3K27me3 is antagonistic to DNA methylation in cis. Furthermore loss of H3K27me3 leads to a gain in promoter DNA methylation in developmental genes in ESCs and in lineage genes during differentiation. Thus our data suggest a role for PRC2 in coordinating dynamic gene repression while protecting against inappropriate promoter DNA methylation during differentiation.

Here we present genome-scale DNA methylation maps for both the paternal and maternal genomes of Tet3-depleted and/or DNA replication-inhibited zygotes. In both genomes we found that inhibition of DNA replication blocks DNA demethylation independently from Tet3 function and that Tet3 facilitates DNA demethylation by coupling with DNA replication.

This A to I editing is widespread and required for normal life and development. Besides mRNAs and repetitive elements ADARs can target miRNA precursors. Editing of miRNA precursors can affect processing efficiency and alter target specificity. Interestingly ADARs can also influence miRNA abundance independent of RNA-editing. In mouse embryos where editing levels are low ADAR2 was found to be the major ADAR protein that affects miRNA abundance. Here we extend our analysis to adult mouse brains where high editing levels are observed. Results: Using Illumina deep sequencing we compare the abundances of mature miRNAs and editing events within them between wild-type and ADAR2 knockout mice in the adult mouse brain. Reproducible changes in abundance of specific miRNAs are observed in ADAR2 deficient mice. Most of these quantitative changes seem unrelated to A to I editing events. However many A to G transitions in cDNAs prepared from mature miRNA sequences reflecting A to I editing events in the RNA are observed with frequencies reaching up to 80%. About half of these editing events are primarily caused by ADAR2 while a few miRNAs show increased editing in the absence of ADAR2 suggesting preferential editing by ADAR1. Moreover novel previously unknown editing events were identified in several miRNAs. In general 64% of all editing events are located within the seed region of mature miRNAs. In one of these cases retargeting of the edited miRNA could be verified in reporter assays. Also altered processing efficiency upon editing near a processing site could be experimentally verified. Conclusions: ADAR2 can significantly influence the abundance of certain miRNAs in the brain. Only in a few cases changes in miRNA abundance can be explained by miRNA editing. Thus ADAR2 binding to miRNA precursors without editing them may influence their processing and thereby abundance. ADAR1 and ADAR2 have both overlapping and distinct specificities for editing of miRNA editing sites. Over 60% of editing occurs in the seed region possibly changing target specificities for many edited miRNAs.

However due to the rare and transient nature of the HE little is known about the initial role of RUNX1 within this population. We therefore developed and implemented a highly sensitive DamID (DNA adenine methyltransferase identification) based methodology including a novel data analysis pipeline to map early RUNX1 transcriptional targets in HE cells. This novel transcription factor binding site identification protocol should be widely applicable to other low abundance cell types and factors. Integration of the RUNX1 binding profile with gene expression data revealed an unexpected early role for RUNX1 as a positive regulator of cell adhesion and migration associated genes within the HE.

Using deep single-cell RNA-seq of matched sister blastomeres we report highly reproducible interblastomere differences among ten 2-cell and five 4-cell mouse embryos. Inter-blastomere gene expression differences dominated between-embryo differences and noises and were sufficient to cluster sister blastomeres into distinct groups. Dozens of protein-coding genes exhibited reproducible bimodal expression in sister blastomeres (0 vs. 1e3-1e6 of FPKM) which cannot be explained by random fluctuations. The protein expression of one of these bimodal genes Gadd45a exhibited clear inter-blastomeric contrasts.

Here we report that some of these sequences are immune to widespread erasure of DNA methylation in the mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) lacking de novo DNA methyltransferases. Persistence of DNA methylation at these loci in mESCs depends on the histone H3K9 methyltransferase Setdb1 as deletion of Setdb1 results in reduction of H3K9me3 and DNA methylation levels concomitant with an increase in 5-hydroxymethylation (5hmC). In addition depletion of H3K9 methyltransferase G9a leads to genome-wide reduction of DNA methylation but to a lesser extent at the above sequences.

The lens has a particularly biased transcriptome with the top 50 genes encoding approximately 90% of the protein content. Using RNA-Seq we have shown that there are over 7	700 genes being expressed in the lens at embryonic day 15.5. As expected the crystallins and many structural genes were amoung the most highly expressed; however numerous genes expressed at lower transcript abundance were also identified. This study provides a framework for the application of RNA-Seq technology towards characterization of the mammalian lens transcriptome during development. Using high-throughput RNA-sequencing gene expression in the mammalian lens was compared between an inbred C56Bl/6&lt;har&gt; strain and a mix background strain at E15.5. This analysis identifies almost 2	000 genes being differentially expressed between the inbred and mixed background lenses ranging from 6.5 fold upregulated to 5.2 fold downregulated in the mixed background compared to the inbred strain. This list does not include unknown/predicted genes or pseudogenes which are known to change between strains. Further it appears that approximately 98% of these genes are altered at levels less than 2.5 fold. This study therefore provides a fold change threshold cutoff (2.5 fold) to use in the analysis of differentially expressed lens genes at E15.5 using RNA-Seq technology as it takes into account genetic variation due to background strain differences. SIP1 encodes a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates multiple developmental processes as highlighted by the pleiotropic defects observed in Mowat-Wilson Syndrome which results from mutations in this gene. Further in adults dysregulated SIP1 expression has been implicated in both cancer and fibrotic diseases where it functionally links TGFb signaling to the loss of epithelial preferred gene expression. In the ocular lens an epithelial tissue important for vision Sip1 is co-expressed with epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and is required for the complete separation of the lens vesicle from the head ectoderm during early ocular morphogenesis. However the function of Sip1 after early lens morphogenesis is still unknown. Here we conditionally deleted Sip1 from the developing mouse lens shortly after lens vesicle closure leading to defects in coordinated fiber cell tip migration defective suture formation and cataract. Interestingly RNA-Sequencing analysis on Sip1 knockout lenses identified 190 differentially expressed genes all of which are distinct from previously described Sip1 target genes involved in EMT/cancer. Furthermore 34% of the upregulated genes in the Sip1 knockout lenses are normally downregulated as the lens transitions from the lens vesicle to early lens while 49% of the genes downregulated in the Sip1 knockout lenses are normally upregulated during early lens development. Overall these data imply that Sip1 plays a major role in reprogramming the lens vesicle away from a surface ectoderm cell fate towards that necessary for the development of a transparent lens and demonstrate that Sip1 regulates distinctly different sets of genes in different cellular contexts.

The alternative functional phenotype of FAPs - either supportive of muscle regeneration or promoting fibro-adipogenic degeneration - is a key determinant in the pathogenesis of muscular diseases including Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). However the molecular regulation of FAPs is still unknown. We show here that an HDAC-myomiR-BAF60 variant network regulates the functional phenotype of FAPs in dystrophic muscles of mdx mice. Combinatorial analysis of gene expression microarray and genome-wide chromatin remodeling by Nuclease accessibility (NA)-seq revealed that HDAC inhibitors de-repress a latent myogenic program in FAPs from dystrophic muscles at early stages of disease progression. In these cells HDAC inhibition promoted the expression of two core components of the myogenic transcriptional machinery MyoD and BAF60C and upregulated the myomiRs (miRs) miR-1.2 miR-133 and miR-206 which target two alternative BAF60 variants (BAF60A and B) ultimately leading to the activation of a pro-myogenic program at the expense of the fibro-adipogenic phenotype. By contrast FAPs from dystrophic muscles at late stages of disease progression displayed resistance to HDACi-induced chromatin remodeling at myogenic loci and fail to activate the pro-myogenic phenotype. These results reveal a previously unappreciated disease stage-specific bipotency of mesenchimal cells within the regenerative environment of dystrophic muscles. Resolution of such bi-potency by epigenetic interventions such as HDACi provides the molecular rationale for the in situ reprogramming of target cells to promote therapeutic regeneration of dystrophic muscles.

Baf155 knockdown in ES cells results in misregulation of hundreds of genes (Ho et al. 2009). The Baf155msp3 allele presents a unique case for gene expression analysis wherein the BAF complex appears to be intact in contrast to disruption of the BAF complex when BAF155 function is lost (Chen and Archer 2005; Sohn et al. 2007). To examine gene expression in the Baf155msp3 mutant at the time of neural tube closure we performed RNA-Seq and compared gene expression levels between homozygous wildtype and homozygous mutant embryos. After extensive analysis of the RNA-Seq data comparing all 3 mutants to all 3 WT replicates 78 genes were identified as being upregulated on average in the mutant samples while 22 genes were downregulated. To facilitate an understanding of global gene expression differences Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to assign functional categories to the up- and down-regulated genes in the mutants. The most significant molecular and cellular functions of these genes were: 1. cellular movement (1.46E-04&gt;p&gt;4.12E-02) 2. cell death and survival (2.69E-04&gt;p&gt;4.12E-02) and 3. cell growth and proliferation (2.69E-04&gt;p&gt;3.41E-02). Many neuronal genes were significantly misregulated as well. Overall the RNA-Seq analysis revealed that surprisingly few genes showed altered expression in Baf155 mutant neural tissue given the broad epigenetic role of the BAF complex but included genes involved in neural development and cell survival. Moreover gene expression changes between individual mutants were variable even though the NTD was consistently observed. This suggests that inconsistent gene regulation contributes to failed neural tube closure.

Reduction in mRNA levels led to inefficient amplification of the majority of low to moderately expressed transcripts. Furthermore stochasticity in primer hybridization and/or enzyme incorporation was magnified during the amplification step resulting in significant distortions in fold changes of the transcripts. Consequently the majority of the differentially expressed transcripts identified were either high-expressed and/or exhibited high fold changes.

ADMA is metabolized primarily by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1) and DDAH2. We determined the effect of DDAH1 overexpression on development of allergic inflammation in a mouse model of asthma. The expression of DDAH1 and DDAH2 in mouse lungs was determined by RT-quantitative PCR (qPCR). ADMA levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum samples were determined by mass spectrometry. Wild type and DDAH1-transgenic mice were intratracheally challenged with PBS or house dust mite (HDM). Airway inflammation was assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) total and differential cell counts. The levels of IgE and IgG1 in BALF and serum samples were determined by ELISA. Gene expression in lungs was determined by RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR. Our data showed that the expression of DDAH1 and DDAH2 was decreased in the lungs of mice following HDM exposure which correlated with increased ADMA levels in BALF and serum.

To generate a comprehensive view of the mechanisms involved in SCI pathology we applied RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technology to characterize the temporal changes in global gene expression after contusive SCI in mice. Method Part1: A total of 27 female C57BI/6J mice (10-16 weeks of age; 20-25g; The Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor ME) were used with 9 mice in each of following groups: shame control 2 and 7 days after SCI. The surgical procedure for SCI were described previously [PMID:23289019]. Briefly after anesthetization with a mixed solution of ketamine (80 mg/kg ip) and xylazine (10 mg/kg ip) mice received a dorsal laminectomy at the 9th thoracic vertebral (T9) level to expose the spinal cord and then a moderate T9 contusive injury using an Infinite Horizons impactor (PrecisionSystems and Instrumentation) at 60 kdyn with the spinestabilized using steel stabilizers inserted under the transverse processes one vertebra above and below the injury [PMID:19196178] . The shame control mice received only a dorsal laminectomy without contusive injury. Afterwards the wound was sutured in layers bacitracin ointment(Qualitest Pharmaceuticals	Huntsville AL) was applied tothe wound area 0.1mL of a 20 mg/ml stock of gentamicin(ButlerSchein Dublin OH) was injected subcutaneously and the animals recovered on a water-circulating heating pad. Then mice received analgesic agent buprenorphin(0.05 mg/kg SQ; Reckitt Benckise Hull England)twice a day for two days. Bladders were manually expressed until automatic voiding returned spontaneously which generally was within 7 days. At 2 or 7 days after SCI the mice were anesthetized again with ketamine and xylazine and perfused briefly with normal physical saline. The injured spinal cords were then dissected and three 0.5 mm pieces of spinal cord were cut in the injured epicenter. All spinal cords were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and processed for RNA isolation. The spinal cords from three mice were combined into one biological replicate for RNA extraction. Three biological replicates were used. Method Part2: RNA-Seq was performed on the polyadenylated fraction of RNA isolated from tissue samples of acute (2D) and subacute phase (7D) and normal tissues (control denoted as CTR hereafter). Three biological replicates were used for each phase.150-300 ng total RNAs were used for each sequencing library. RNA samples were polyA selected and paired-end sequencing libraries were constructed using TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit as described in the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation V2 Guide (Illumina).The samples were then sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq sequencer. More than 30 million 100bp paired-end reads were generated from each biological replicate. Method Part3: Read mapping and Transcriptome construction were done by using optimized pipeline which integrate Tophat followed by Cufflinks. Result: We sequenced tissue samples from acute and subacute phases (2 days and 7 days after injury) and systematically characterized the transcriptomes with the goal of identifying pathways and genes critical in SCI pathology. The top enriched functional categories include \\x89\\xdb\\xf7inflammation response\\x89\\xdb\\xaa \\x89\\xdb\\xf7neurological disease\\x89\\xdb\\xaa \\x89\\xdb\\xf7cell death and survival\\x89\\xdb\\xaa and \\x89\\xdb\\xf7nervous system development\\x89\\xdb\\xaa. The top enriched pathways include LXR/RXR Activation and Atherosclerosis Signaling etc. Furthermore we developed a systems-based analysis framework in order to identify key determinants in the global gene networks of the acute and sub-acute phases. Some candidate genes that we identified have been shown to play important roles in SCI which demonstrates the validity of our approach. There are also many genes whose functions in SCI have not been well studied and can be further investigated by future experiments. We have also incorporated pharmacogenomic information into our analyses. Among the genes identified the ones with existing drug information can be readily tested in SCI animal models. Conclusion: in this study we have described an example of how global gene profiling can be translated to screening genes of interest and generating new hypotheses. Additionally the RNA-seq enables splicing isoform identification and the estimation of expression levels thus providing useful information for increasing the specificity of drug design and reducing potential side effect.

One way to look at the process of brain development is to examine gene expression changes and previous studies have used microarrays to address this in a global manner. However the transcriptome is more complex than gene expression levels alone as both alternative splicing and RNA editing occur to generate a more diverse set of mature transcripts. The aim of the current study was to develop a high-resolution transcriptome dataset of mouse cortical development using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) thus assaying exon usage and RNA editing as well as overcoming some of the inherent limitations of microarrays.

The class of miRNA is diverse and there exist noncanonical miRNAs that bypass the canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway. In order to identify noncanonical miRNAs and endo-siRNAs responding to virus infection and study their potential function we sequenced small-RNA species from cells lytically infected with murine gammaherpesvirus 68. In addition to 3 novel canonical miRNAs in mouse two antisense miRNAs in virus and 25 novel noncanonical miRNAs including miRNAs derived from tRNAs snoRNAs and introns in the host were identified. These noncanonical miRNAs exhibited features distinct from canonical miRNAs in the lengths and structures of miRNA hairpins as well as base pairings and first nucleotide preference. Many of the novel miRNAs are conserved in mammals. In addition to several known murine endo-siRNAs detected by the sequencing profiling a novel locus in the mouse genome was identified to give rise to endo-siRNAs. This novel endo-siRNA locus is comprised of two tandem inverted B4 short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs). Unexpectedly the SINE-derived endo-siRNAs were found in a variety of sequencing data as well as virus-infected cells. Moreover a murine miRNA was up-regulated more than 35 fold in infected than in mock-treated cells. The putative target genes of the viral and the up-regulated murine miRNAs were potentially involved in processes of gene transcription and protein phosphorylation and localized to membranes suggesting their role in manipulating the host basal immune system during lytic infection.

Using ChIP-seq and gene expression analyses we show that in primary myoblasts Snai1/2-HDAC1/2 repressive complex bind and exclude MyoD from its targets. Notably Snail binds E-box motifs that are G/C-rich in their central dinucleotides and such sites are almost exclusively associated with genes expressed during differentiation. By contrast Snai1/2 does not bind the A/T-rich E-boxes associated with MyoD targets in myoblasts. Thus Snai1/2-HDAC1/2 prevents MyoD occupancy on differentiation-specific regulatory elements and the change from Snail1/2- to MyoD-binding often results in enhancer switching during differentiation. Furthermore we show that a regulatory network involving Myogenic Regulatory Factors (MRFs) Snail/2 miR-30a and miR-206 acts as a molecular switch that controls entry into myogenic differentiation. Together these results reveal a regulatory paradigm that directs distinct gene expression programs in progenitors versus terminally differentiated cells.

To this end we have generated a streamlined bioinformatic pipeline available to the scientific community which maps RNA-Seq reads to a complex combinatorial database of exon-exon junctions for the unique junction discovery PTC detection and identification of splice isoforms. Hence we have incorporated a splice isoform inference and PTC detection algorithm which facilitates a highly accurate mapping and prediction of splice isoform junctions and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)-susceptibility. We used this pipeline to investigate the complexity of the transcriptome and global role of AS-NMD in vivo in mammalian cells by taking advantage of our Upf2 conditional knock-out mouse. Using tissue-specific Cre deleter strains we have previously demonstrated in vivo that NMD acts to degrade many transcripts that results from AS. Also ablating UPF2 (a core NMD factor) in the mouse leads to rapid mortality and collapse of most organs tested (Thoren et al. 2010; Weischenfeldt et al. 2008) suggesting an essential function for NMD in AS. To explore the effect of NMD on global splicing and to generate and validate an attractive bioinformatic pipeline for the scientific community to study AS and NMD we chose to analyze two different mammalian organ systems with distinct phenotypes upon UPF2 ablation to test the robustness and dynamic range of the analysis. In one end of the spectrum we chose to analyze the liver wherein removal of UPF2 results in failure in liver metabolism and a high mortality rate (Thoren et al. 2010). To profile a less affected tissue we chose to analyze bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). These are macrophages that differentiate in vitro and Upf2 deleted BMMs are completely devoid of NMD activity but nevertheless show no morphological or functional phenotype compared to wild-type controls (Weischenfeldt et al. 2008). Thus we were able to make a direct comparison between these two tissues to demonstrate the potency of our Isoform and PTC detection pipeline described below which will allow the scientific community to analyze transcriptome data for global AS and NMD-susceptibility.

Mice lacking Klf1 die in utero prior to E15 from severe anemia due to the inadequate expression of genes controlling hemoglobin production cell membrane and cytoskeletal integrity and the cell cycle and proliferation. We have recently described the full repertoire of Klf1 binding sites in vivo by performing Klf1 ChIP-seq in primary erythroid tissue (E14.5 fetal liver). Here we describe the Klf1-dependent erythroid transcriptome by comparing mRNA-seq from Klf1+/+ and Klf1-/- erythroid tissue. This has revealed novel target genes not previously obtainable by traditional microarray technology and provided novel insights into the function of Klf1 as a transcriptional activator such as interactions with Gata1 Scl/Tal1 and p300. We also describe a set of erythroid specific promoters not previously identified that drive high level expression of otherwise ubiquitously expressed genes in erythroid cells. Additionally our study has identified for the first time two novel lnc-RNAs that are dynamically expressed during erythroid differentiation as well as a role for Klf1 in directing apoptotic gene expression to drive the terminal stages of erythroid maturation.

Here we applied Next Generation Sequencing of the transcriptome (RNA-Seq) to purified sensory neurons and cerebellar granular neurons (CGNs) grown on an axonal growth permissive substrate. The goal of the analysis was to uncover neuronal type specific isoforms as a prelude to understanding patterns of gene expression underlying their intrinsic growth abilities. Global gene expression patterns were comparable to those found for other cell types in that a vast majority of genes were expressed at low abundance. Nearly 18% of gene loci produced more than one transcript. More than 8000 isoforms were differentially expressed either to different degrees in different neuronal types or uniquely expressed in one or the other. Sensory neurons expressed a larger number of genes and gene isoforms than did CGNs. To begin to understand the mechanisms responsible for the differential gene/isoform expression we identified transcription factor binding sites present specifically in the upstream genomic sequences of differentially expressed isoforms and analyzed the 3\\x89\\xdb\\xaa untranslated regions (3\\x89\\xdb\\xaa UTRs) for microRNA (miRNA) target sites.

To develop more robust bioinformatic approaches to analyze high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data with the focus on the investigation of transcriptome complexity at individual exon and transcript levels. In addition to overall gene expression analysis the methods developed in this study were used to analyze RNA-Seq data with respect to individual transcript isoforms novel spliced exons novel alternative terminal exons novel transcript clusters (i.e. novel genes) and long non-coding RNA genes. We applied these approaches to RNA-Seq data obtained from mouse hearts following pressure-overload induced by trans-aortic constriction. Based on experimental validations analyses of the features of the identified exons/transcripts and expression analyses including previously published RNA-Seq data we demonstrate that the methods are highly effective in detecting and quantifying individual exons and transcripts. Novel insights inferred from the examined aspects of the cardiac transcriptome open ways to further experimental investigations. Our work provided a comprehensive set of methods to analyze mouse cardiac transcriptome complexity at individual exon and transcript levels. Applications of the methods may infer important new insights to gene regulation in normal and disease hearts in terms of exon utilization and potential involvement of novel components of cardiac transcriptome.
